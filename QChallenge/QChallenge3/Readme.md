# Rugby World Cup Final Prediction Challenge
  
On Saturday, October 28th, South Africa will face New Zealand in the Rugby World Cup final in France.

## Challenge Description

In the data folder, you will find a CSV file containing statistics of Rugby matches. While the data is comprehensive, it is a bit outdated, and we need to enhance it with a few recent results.
 
**Your task** is to develop a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithm that can predict the winner of the Rugby World Cup final. To accomplish this, you should consider the following steps:

1. **Data Pre-processing**: Decide on a relevant data pre-processing scheme. You may need to clean and format the data to make it suitable for your prediction model.

2. **Data Encoding**: Determine how you will encode the data to be compatible with quantum algorithms. Quantum feature maps, amplitude encoding, or other quantum data encoding techniques can be explored.

3. **Algorithm Choice**: Choose a QML algorithm or a combination of algorithms that you believe will be effective for this prediction task. Options include quantum kernels, parametric circuits, or any other QML algorithms available to you.

4. **Creativity**: This challenge encourages creativity, so feel free to explore novel approaches and ideas to improve the accuracy of your predictions.

Good luck, and may the best quantum model win!
